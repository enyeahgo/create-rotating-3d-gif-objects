My personal process on how to create 3d logos (.stl) as gif and make it rotate on top of another gif background.
<br><br>**Create the Logo**
1. Create your png logo in Auto Sketch.
2. Convert it to 3d model (.stl) using [Selva3d](http://app.selva3d.com/) (need to create account to be able to use).
3. View the 3d model with [Viewstl](https://www.viewstl.com/).
4. Change its color accordingly.
5. Capture the rotation animation using any screen recorder.
6. Trim the output video accordingly.
7. Edit the video in [EzGif](https://ezgif.com) paying particular attention to removing the background by clicking 'effects'->'Replace color with Transparency' or by replacing color with its hex codes. Also if you want the logo in gold then tick the Sepia effect.
<br><br>**Create the Background**
1. Download your desired video from Youtube using any Youtube video downloader.
2. Trim the video accordingly.
3. Convert each trimmed output videos into gif using [EzGif](https://ezgif.com).
4. Merge gif using same site.
<br><br>**Combine the Two Gifs**
1. Use Google Slides and import both the gifs.
2. Make sure to put both gifs to 'Wrap Text' so you can put the logo gif on top of the background gif.
3. Play powerpoint and capture the scene using any screen recorder.
4. Convert the output video into gif again using [EzGif](https://ezgif.com).
5. And I think that's it. You now have your own rotating gif logo on top of a gif background.
